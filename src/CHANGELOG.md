## AI-Generated Personalized Content - October 25, 2025

### ü§ñ Dynamic AI Content Generation with YouTube Integration

Complete overhaul to make roadmaps and content truly personalized using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini. Each user gets unique, AI-generated learning materials.

#### New AI-Powered Features
- **Personalized Roadmap Generation**: OpenAI generates custom roadmaps based on user profile
- **Dynamic Topic Content**: AI creates detailed explanations for each topic when clicked
- **YouTube Video Recommendations**: AI selects specific search queries for relevant tutorials
- **Cached Content**: Generated content is saved to avoid regeneration

#### New Backend Endpoints
- **`POST /generate-topic-content`**: Generates comprehensive topic content with:
  - Detailed explanations (200-300 words)
  - Key learning points (5-7 bullets)
  - Real-world applications
  - Common pitfalls to avoid
  - Practice suggestions
  - YouTube video search queries
- **`GET /topic-content/:moduleId/:topic`**: Retrieves cached topic content
- **Enhanced `/progress`**: Now tracks completed topics array

#### New Components
- **`/components/CoursePageEnhanced.tsx`**: Full AI-powered course page with:
  - Click-to-generate topic content
  - Loading states for AI generation
  - YouTube video cards with search links
  - Structured content sections (explanation, key points, applications, pitfalls, practice)
  - Topic-level progress tracking

#### Updated Components
- **`/App.tsx`**: Uses CoursePageEnhanced with profile data
- **`/utils/api.ts`**: Added `generateTopicContent` and `getTopicContent` methods
- **`/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`**: 
  - Enhanced progress tracking with `completedTopics` array
  - New topic content generation endpoint
  - OpenAI integration for dynamic content

#### How It Works
1. User completes onboarding with their profile details
2. OpenAI generates a personalized roadmap based on their background, skills, and goals
3. When user clicks a module, they see the topics
4. Clicking any topic triggers AI to generate:
   - Comprehensive explanation
   - Key concepts
   - Real-world use cases
   - YouTube video search queries
5. Content is cached for instant loading on subsequent visits
6. Each user gets unique content tailored to their learning path
